# YouTube Clone – HTML & CSS

A simple clone of YouTube’s homepage built using only HTML and CSS.

This was a practice project to improve my front-end skills and understand how real web layouts are structured.

### 📁 What’s Inside:
- `index.html` – main page
- `youtube-styles/` – all CSS files (header, sidebar, layout)
- `thumbnails/` – sample video thumbnails

No JavaScript. Just clean HTML + CSS.
